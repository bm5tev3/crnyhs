### Guiding principles

1. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
        1. In order for our app to be widely adopted, it needs to be simple to use.
3. Google it
  	1. New problems are relative, it's likely someone else has come across it or a similar problem and a solution has been posted online.
5. [Program in pairs](https://youtu.be/hc7jHnH5ijE)

### FAQ

Q: Why did you decide on R (over Python) as the programming language for Gallagher's List?
A: We decided on R because, R is easier to build visualization for oue web app, Gallagher's list. R also supports tidyverse which allows us to visualize data when we are modeling. 

Q: What resources did you consider in making this decision?
A: These links helped me with this descision, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gdKC5O0Pwc and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-vs-python/

Q: How do I get updates from the github repo into posit cloud?
A: First select the git tab in posit cloud and then click pull the select the 3 dot icon and relaunch project. 

### User questions 

1. What are your goals when using this web app
2. Are there any other tools you'll find useful 
3. What are some requirements that should be taken into account durring the developemy of the web app
4. What are you looking to accomplished while using this app 
5. Is there anything else you'd like to share

### Sean's meeting notes
the app should have info on: 
-who is the person 
-where do they work 
-what is their skill set/ position 
-background/experience 

the person doing the sereach should know who is recommanding the person
*maybe pull information from LinkedIn
get people into putting in information
be able to serach skills and specific people would poped up (skill selection) 

requirments:
-making it as simpile as possible 
-make the sereach easy (word choice) 

-make sure you actually know the person you are recommanding 
-perhaps have ratings for the people.( simple; have indivival rating) Have up votes and down votes, people would be able to see why.

### Does the app have this?
- [ ] Does the app ask who is using the app
- [ ] Does it ask for the purpose of using the app
- [ ] Ask further questions to gather more about the user needs
- [ ] Is there a skill section?
- [ ] Is the user able to add any discriptions about the recommendees
- [ ] Is there a rating system in place?

When adding these functions into app they should be in the simpliest form to not overload the user when in use.
The simpler the layout the better the use will be.
