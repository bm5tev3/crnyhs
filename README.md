### FAQ

Q: Why did you decide on R (over Python) as the programming language for Gallagher's List?
A: We decided on R because, R is easier to build visualization for oue web app, Gallagher's list. R also supports tidyverse which allows us to visualize data when we are modeling. 

Q: What resources did you consider in making this decision?
A: These links helped me with this descision, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gdKC5O0Pwc and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-vs-python/

Q: How do I get updates from the github repo into posit cloud?
A: First select the git tab in posit cloud and then click pull the select the 3 dot icon and relaunch project. 

### User questions 

1. What are your goals when using this web app
2. Are there any other tools you'll find useful 
3. What are some requirements that should be taken into account durring the developemy of the web app
4. What are you looking to accomplished while using this app 
5. Is there anything else you'd like to share

### Does the app have this?
- [ ] Does the app ask who is using the app
- [ ] Does it ask for the purpose of using the app
- [ ] Ask further questions to gather more about the user needs
- [ ] Is there a skill section?
- [ ] Is the user able to add any discriptions about the recommendees

When adding these functions into app they should be in the simpliest form to not overload the user when in use.
The simpler the layout the better the use will be.
